TERM,SCHEMA
Natural Selection,"The process by which organisms better adapted to their environment have higher survival and reproduction rates, leading to the prevalence of advantageous traits in the population.; The peppered moth's coloration change during the Industrial Revolution.; associated terms: Evolution, Adaptation, Fitness"
Mutation,"Permanent changes in an organism's DNA, leading to genetic diversity. Mutations can be benign, deleterious, or advantageous and contribute to evolution by introducing new traits.; The development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria.; associated terms: DNA replication, Genetic variation, Alleles"
Genetic Drift,"A mechanism of evolution caused by random fluctuations in allele frequencies within a population, especially significant in small populations.; Founder effect in Amish populations.; associated terms: Population bottleneck, Founder effect, Allele frequency"
Gene Flow,"The transfer of alleles or genes from one population to another due to migration, enhancing genetic diversity in the recipient population.; Pollen transfer between plant populations.; associated terms: Migration, Genetic variation, Population genetics"
Adaptation,"The process by which a species becomes better suited to its environment through the development and propagation of beneficial traits.; The development of thick fur in arctic animals.; associated terms: Natural selection, Fitness, Environmental pressure"
Speciation,"The evolutionary process through which new biological species arise due to reproductive isolation and genetic divergence.; Darwin's finches in the Galápagos Islands.; associated terms: Reproductive isolation, Genetic divergence, Allopatric speciation"
Founder Effect,"A type of genetic drift where a new population starts with a small number of individuals, leading to reduced genetic variation and potentially different allele frequencies compared to the original population.; Genetic traits in the population of Tristan da Cunha.; associated terms: Genetic drift, Population genetics, Bottleneck effect"
Bottleneck Effect,"A sharp reduction in the size of a population due to environmental or other pressures, causing a significant loss of genetic diversity.; Northern Elephant Seals' near extinction in the 19th century.; associated terms: Population dynamics, Genetic variation, Extinction"
Allopatric Speciation,"The formation of a new species due to geographical separation, leading to genetic isolation and divergent evolution.; Speciation of squirrels in the Grand Canyon.; associated terms: Geographic barrier, Reproductive isolation, Divergent evolution"
Sympatric Speciation,"The evolution of a new species from a common ancestor within the same geographic area, often driven by ecological factors and sexual selection.; Cichlid fish in African lakes.; associated terms: Reproductive isolation, Niche differentiation, Ecological speciation"
Phylogeny,"The evolutionary history and lineage of species or groups of species, depicted as a phylogenetic tree showing ancestral relations.; The phylogenetic tree of life.; associated terms: Cladistics, Evolutionary tree, Common ancestor"
Synapomorphy,"A characteristic present in an ancestral species and shared exclusively by its evolutionary descendants.; Amniotic egg in reptiles, birds, and mammals.; associated terms: Clade, Monophyletic group, Homology"
Sexual Selection,"A type of natural selection where certain traits increase an individual's chances of mating, which can result in complex mating behaviors and features.; The elaborate tail feathers of a peacock.; associated terms: Mate choice, Intrasexual competition, Secondary sexual characteristics"
Birds of Paradise,"A group of bird species known for their elaborate courtship displays and plumage, exemplifying sexual selection.; The courtship dance of the Greater Bird-of-Paradise.; associated terms: Sexual dimorphism, Mate selection, Behavioral ecology"
Lynn Margulis,"Biologist and evolutionist best known for her theory on the origin of eukaryotic organelles, and her contributions to the endosymbiotic theory.; The origin of mitochondria in eukaryotic cells.; associated terms: Symbiogenesis, Endosymbiotic theory, Mitochondrial DNA"
Peppered Moths,"A classic example of natural selection in which the coloration of the species changed due to industrial soot; Light-colored moths became rare and dark-colored moths common in polluted areas.; associated terms: Industrial melanism, Directional selection, Adaptive trait"
Galápagos Finches,"A group of finch species that exhibit a remarkable variety of beak shapes, studied by Charles Darwin; Variations in beak shape correlate with different feeding strategies.; associated terms: Adaptive radiation, Evolutionary biology, Beak morphology"
Charles Darwin,"Naturalist who formulated the theory of evolution by natural selection; Authored 'On the Origin of Species'; His observations of Galápagos wildlife were critical to his theories.; associated terms: Evolution, Survival of the fittest, Darwinism"
Jean-Baptiste Lamarck,"Early evolutionary theorist who proposed that organisms could pass on traits acquired during their lifetimes; Introduced the concept of use and disuse in evolution.; associated terms: Lamarckism, Inheritance of acquired characteristics, Evolutionary theory"
