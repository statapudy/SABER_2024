Natural Selection,"Definition: Natural selection is the process where organisms better adapted to their environment survive and reproduce more. This makes helpful traits more common over generations.; Characteristics: Natural selection works on phenotypes in a population. It reduces the number of less helpful alleles and increases the frequency of helpful ones. It can create adaptations that improve an organism's ability to survive and reproduce. It is a main cause of new species, especially when a population is split into different environments.; Examples: The peppered moth's color change during the Industrial Revolution: Dark-colored moths became more common because pollution made tree bark darker, hiding them from predators. White-colored moths became more common after clean air laws made trees cleaner. The development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria: Bacteria with mutations that resist antibiotics survive and reproduce more. Overuse of antibiotics has led to the evolution of dangerous strains like MRSA.; Related Terms: Evolution, Adaptation, Fitness, Directional Selection, Stabilizing Selection, Disruptive Selection; Important Scientists: Charles Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace, Hopi Hoekstra, Rosemary Gillespie, Scott Edwards"
Mutation,"Definition: A mutation is a permanent change in an organism's DNA that leads to genetic diversity. Mutations can be neutral, harmful, or helpful, and they introduce new traits into a population.; Characteristics: Mutations can happen naturally during DNA copying or be caused by the environment. The effect of a mutation depends on what it is and where it happens. Mutations are the main source of genetic variation, which is needed for evolution. Somatic mutations do not pass to the next generation and usually do not enter the gene pool; they may cause cancer. Germ-line mutations can enter the gene pool.; Examples: The development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria: Random mutations in bacterial DNA can resist antibiotics, helping those bacteria survive and grow. Sickle cell anemia in humans: A single change in the hemoglobin gene causes sickle-shaped red blood cells, which help people survive malaria.; Related Terms: DNA Replication, Genetic Variation, Alleles, Point Mutation, Frameshift Mutation, Silent Mutation, CRISPR-Cas9, Gene Editing; Important Scientists: Hermann Muller, Barbara McClintock, Jennifer Doudna"
Genetic Drift,"Definition: Genetic drift is a process of evolution where allele frequencies change randomly in a population, especially in small populations.; Characteristics: Genetic drift can cause big genetic changes in small populations due to chance. It can reduce genetic variation within populations and increase differences between populations. Unlike natural selection, genetic drift happens by chance, not because of fitness.; Examples: Population bottleneck in northern elephant seals: A big drop in population size due to hunting led to a loss of genetic diversity. Population decline in greater prairie chickens: Habitat destruction caused a big drop in population size, reducing genetic variation.; Related Terms: Population Bottleneck, Founder Effect, Allele Frequency, Neutral Evolution; Important Scientists: Theodosius Dobzhansky, Motoo Kimura‚Äù"
Evolution,"Definition: Evolution, as related to genomics, refers to the process by which living organisms change over time through changes in the genome"
Ecology,Definition: The branch of biology that deals with the relations of organisms to one another and to their physical surroundings.
